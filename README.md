# Event Listener in JavaScript

An event listener in JavaScript is a mechanism used to listen for specific events happening on HTML elements and execute a function in response to those events. This is a fundamental concept in building interactive web applications.

## How to Use Event Listeners

To add an event listener to an HTML element in JavaScript, you typically follow these steps:

1. **Select the HTML element:** First, you need to select the HTML element you want to add the event listener to. You can use methods like `document.getElementById`, `document.querySelector`, or `document.querySelectorAll` to select elements.

2. **Define the event listener function:** Create a function that will be executed when the event occurs. This function will contain the actions you want to perform in response to the event.

3. **Attach the event listener:** Use the `addEventListener` method to attach the event listener to the selected HTML element. Specify the type of event you want to listen for (e.g., 'click', 'mouseover', 'keydown') and the function that should be called when the event occurs.

4. **Handle the event:** Inside the event listener function, you can access information about the event (such as event properties or the event target) and perform any necessary actions based on that information.
